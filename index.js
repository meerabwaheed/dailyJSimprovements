// Monolithic architecture
// Monolithic architecture is a traditional software design where an application is built as a single, unified unit, combining all components (UI, business logic, data access) into one large codebase and deployable artifact. This approach simplifies development and deployment for small applications but can lead to challenges in scalability, maintainability, and flexibility as the application grows in complexity.
